# Shell and Git

You just need to know the stuff you've been doing all semester!

## Basic Shell

1. How do you see what directory you're currently in?
2. How do you change your working directory? To a subfolder? To a parent directory?
3. How can you see the full content of a file? How can you peek the beginning/ending content?
4. How can see all files in your current directory? What flag do you need for hidden files? What flag to show file permissions?

## Git

Again, just think the basics

1. How to stage changes for commits
2. How to commit changes with a message
3. How to create/checkout a new branch
4. How to push changes to a remote (github) repository
5. How to see a list of all commits

> If this is no-stress for you, great job! You've successfully become really comfortable with git (an in-demand and employable skill)

## Cargo

1. How do you create a new rust project?
2. How do you run a rust project?
3. How do you check if a rust project will compile
4. How do you run all tests for a cargo project? How do you run certain tests?
5. How do you compile the rust binary? How do you do this without debugging safety rails?
